\subsection{Feed-Forward Neural Network} Both feed-forward networks
achieved good accuracy on the validation set. The multiple hidden

counter part. This could be because of the deeper layers learning more
complex relationships between the tokens in the tweet. As the single
hidden layer was learning patterns of spam tweets.
