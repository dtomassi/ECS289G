\section{Conclusions}
This project aimed to classify a twitter account as a spam or not spam by using only a tweet text. We successfully got a good accuracy in two different approaches for the word embedding and tried to develop four models. The best accuracy obtained was $93.5$\%, from training using multiple hidden layer feed-forward neural network with Word2Vec embedding. We also observe that we got better results with Word2Vec embedding. However, for future work can involve LSTM with Word2Vec embedding and using GloVe with single-layer feed-forward neural network and multiple-layer feed-forward neural network.
