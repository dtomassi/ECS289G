\section{Conclusions}
This project aimed to classify a twitter account as a spam or not spam by using only a tweet text. We used two different approaches for the word embedding and tried to develop four models. The best accuracy was the one with multiple hidden layer feed-forward neural network and embedding trained on our won data with 93.5\% accuracy.
