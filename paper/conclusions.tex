\section{Conclusions}
This project aimed to classify a twitter account as a spam or not spam by using only a tweet text. We successfully got a good accuracy in two different approaches for the word embedding and tried to develop four models. The best accuracy obtained was $93.5$\%, from training using multiple hidden layer feed-forward neural network with Word2Vec embedding.
